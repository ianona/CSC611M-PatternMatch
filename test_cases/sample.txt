The issues raised by Karl Marx as presented in the videos allowed me to see the problems inherent in a capitalist system that exploits its workers. One idea that I agree with is the prevalence of alienation when one is isolated from the value they create or from the product of their work. Although I am skeptical about our species-essence being directly tied to our occupation, I can agree that work is an essential part of our survival and an opportunity for us to express ourselves. I can say from experience that there is an undeniable lack of fulfilment when we work jobs that under-utilise our creative facilities or that do not fully maximise our human potential. I also think that a lot of the issues presented in the videos were more common in the time of Marx than it is today. With globalisation and the rapid growth of technology & automation, industries are being reformed to promote knowledge work which pushes people into more stimulating occupations. I think today, it's simply matter of making better opportunities available for everyone through education so that people from all walks of life are better equipped to participate in our modern economy.
