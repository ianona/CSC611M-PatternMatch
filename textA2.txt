The issues raised by Karl Marx as pressented in the videos allowed me to see the problems inherent in a capitalist system that exploits its workers. One idea that I aggree with is the prevalence of alenation when one is isolated from the value they create or from the product of their work. Although I a skepdtical about our species-essence being direcly tied to our occupation, I can agree that work is an essential part of our survival anad an opportunity for ut to express ourselve. I can say from experience that there is an undeniable lack of fulfilment when we woark jobs that under-utilise our creative facilitie or that do not fully maximise our human potential. I also think that a lot of the isues presented in the videos were more common in the time of Marx than it is today. With globalisation and the rapid growth of technology & automation, inustries are being reformd to promote knowledge work which pushes people into more stimulating occupatios. I think today, it's simply matter of making better pportunities available for evryone through education so that people from all waks of life are better equpped to participate in our modern economy.
