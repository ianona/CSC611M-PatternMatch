Some love them. Some hate them.

But nobody working in education today can escape pandemic learning pods: the increasingly popular phenomenon in which families band together and hire a private tutor to offer in-person learning to a small group of children.

Teachers throughout the nation are sketching out schedules and pondering whether they can squeeze in pod tutoring after virtual school. They are weighing health risks, deciding on ground rules — should all pod students wear masks? — and asking parents how much they will pay. (A lot, it turns out.) Sometimes, they are quitting their jobs to lead pods instead.

That is what Kendra Newton is doing: The 24-year-old first-grade teacher resigned from her job with Orange County Public Schools in Florida after learning she would have to teach in-person this fall. She is moving across the country to Oregon, where she will lead a pod of eight students — for a higher salary than she earned in Florida.

“It gave me a way to feel safe working,” Newton said. “I will have guaranteed money coming in and a stable idea of what my life will be like because there won’t be a school district changing its mind every two seconds. For my mental health, it’s just a better option.”

For parents who can afford it, a solution for fall: Bring the teachers to them

No reliable data exists on how many teachers have left, or are considering leaving, their jobs to teach pods. But worried school officials are sending emails claiming pods pose just as much of a health risk as returning to the classroom. Some are warning teachers that pods will drive inequity. Others are scrambling to figure out if they can somehow co-opt the pod model.

Still, others are announcing that employees who try to lead pods while keeping their regular teaching jobs will risk getting fired — even as they hope they do not have to follow through on that threat.

“As a reminder . . . [Arlington Public Schools] teachers are not permitted to take on additional positions such as tutoring or learning supervision during the school day,” officials in the Northern Virginia district wrote in a recent message to staff. “Nor are they allowed to tutor students they work with . . . outside of the classroom for pay.”

Stacy Reiber, a New Jersey elementary school teacher, quit a 20-year teaching career this summer to lead a pod. Come fall, she will instruct six children in a private home — first outside, then in a garage with heaters — for $15 per hour per child (a small pay cut).

“I’m going to get to know every kid in my pod because I won’t be juggling 25 kids like I was,” Reiber said. “All teachers want smaller classrooms — so I do believe, actually, that people are going to love what pods offer, and I do think there’s going to be a shift beyond the pandemic.”

She pointed to long-running and well-established problems with the public school system: underpaid teachers, an overemphasis on the use of standardized test scores for evaluation and too-large class sizes.

“I truly hope,” she added, “that [the pods do] reshape American education.”
