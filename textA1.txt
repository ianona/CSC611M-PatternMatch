In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities, sometimes as described by a wave equation. In physical waves, at leas two field quantities in the wave medium are involved. Waves can be periodic, in which case toe quantities oscillate repeatdly about an equlibrium (resting) value at some frequency. When the entire waveform moves in ose direction it is said to be a trveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed periodic waves travelin in opposite directions makes a standing wave. In a staning wave, the ampltude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero.
